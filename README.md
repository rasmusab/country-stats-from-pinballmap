# Contry-level pinball statistics over time

This repo uses [the API of pinballmap.com](https://pinballmap.com/api/v1/docs/1.0/locations/index.html) to, once a week, pull down the latest country-level stats on how many public pinball machines each country has.
This data is also persisted and version in this very repo.
