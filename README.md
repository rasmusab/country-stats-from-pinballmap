# Country-level Pinball Statistics Over Time

This repository uses [the API of pinballmap.com](https://pinballmap.com/api/v1/docs/1.0/locations/index.html) to pull down the latest country-level stats on how many public pinball machines each country has, once a week.
This data is also persisted and versioned in this very repository.
